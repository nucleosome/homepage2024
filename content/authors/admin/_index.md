  - title: Directional Modulation-Enabled Secure Transmission with Intelligent Reflecting Surface

    awarder: Best Presentation Award of IEEE ICICSP 2020

    summary: |
      We propose a new secure transmission scheme which uses directional modulation (DM) with artificial noise and is aided by the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). Specifically, the direct path and IRS-enabled reflect path carry the same confidential signal and thus can be coherently added at the desired position to maximize the total received power, while the received signals at other positions are distorted. We derive a closed-form expression for the secrecy rate achieved by the proposed scheme. Using simulation results, we show that the proposed scheme can achieve two-dimensional secure transmission at a specific position. Also, its performance advantage over the conventional DM scheme becomes more pronounced as the number of reflecting elements at the IRS increases.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

Welcome to my personal website! I'm studying at the Australian National University under the supervision of Xiangyun (Sean) Zhou with a interest in designing a future wireless communication system. When I'm not working on my research, I love to spend time outdoors, exploring nature and trying new things.
